## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Not connected to Agent Hub"
**Solution**: Check API is running on correct port
```powershell
# Check if API is running
dotnet run --project "AI&AI Agent.API/AI&AI Agent.API.csproj"
```

### "Authentication failed"
**Solution**: 
1. Register first if new user
2. Check username/password
3. Token should auto-populate after login

### "No events received"
**Solution**: 
1. Click "🔌 Test Connection" button
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Verify SignalR connection is established

### Stats not updating
**Solution**: 
- Stats update on specific events (RunStarted, StepStarted, ArtifactCreated)
- Try running a complete test to see updates
