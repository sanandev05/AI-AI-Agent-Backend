0) Target outcome (what “Manus-like” means)

A chat UI where the agent can:

Plan tasks,

Use tools (browse web, read/write files, run code safely),

Search your knowledge base (RAG),

Hand off work between specialized agents,

Log everything (costs, tool calls, artifacts) and resume later.

1) Architecture (high level)
[Web UI]  ──>  Orchestrator (SK)
                 ├─ ResearchAgent  (WebSearchTool, SummarizeTool)
                 ├─ CodeAgent      (SandboxedRunTool, PackageGuard)
                 ├─ FilesAgent     (RAG.Search, Read/Write limited FS)
                 └─ OpsAgent       (GitHub/Jira/Email tools - optional)

Infra:
- LLM: OpenAI/Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o/4.1)
- Memory/KB: pgvector or Qdrant
- State: SQL (threads, messages, runs), Redis (short-term)
- Queue: Hangfire for long tools

2) Choose your SK agent type

OpenAIAssistant / AssistantAgent for fast ChatGPT-like threads + tool calls.

Add A2A (Agent-to-Agent) + Orchestration patterns to coordinate multiple agents.

3) Create the Orchestrator (the “boss”)

Reads the user goal, drafts a plan, selects which agent(s) to call, monitors progress, and decides when to stop.

C# sketch

var kernel = Kernel.CreateBuilder()
  .AddOpenAIChatCompletion("gpt-4o", Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
  .Build();

var orchestrator = new AssistantAgent(kernel, new()
{
    Name = "Orchestrator",
    Instructions = """
    You are the project manager. Break the user goal into steps.
    Route steps to the right agent:
    - ResearchAgent: web/data gathering.
    - FilesAgent: retrieve company/user docs with RAG before answering.
    - CodeAgent: write & run code only in sandbox.
    Return a final, concise answer with sources and artifacts.
    """,
});

4) Define specialized agents (skills are isolated)

ResearchAgent

var research = new AssistantAgent(kernel, new()
{
    Name = "ResearchAgent",
    Instructions = "Search the web, extract facts, cite URLs, no code execution.",
});
kernel.ImportPluginFromObject(new WebSearchPlugin(apiKey:"<SERP_API>"), "web");


FilesAgent (RAG)

var files = new AssistantAgent(kernel, new()
{
    Name = "FilesAgent",
    Instructions = "Use RAG to query indexed PDFs/notes. Prefer quoting exact lines.",
});
kernel.ImportPluginFromObject(new RagPlugin(vectorStore), "rag");


CodeAgent (sandbox)

var code = new AssistantAgent(kernel, new()
{
    Name = "CodeAgent",
    Instructions = "Generate and run code only via Sandbox.Run(). Never access network or secrets.",
});
kernel.ImportPluginFromObject(new SandboxPlugin("/srv/sbx"), "sandbox");

5) Tooling (the heart of Manus-like behavior)

Implement tools as SK plugins (C# methods with [KernelFunction]):

WebSearchTool: query a safe search API → return top N results (title, url, snippet).

SummarizeTool: distilled summary with citations (input: HTML/text).

RAGTool: Search(query) -> list<chunk> and GetDoc(id) using pgvector/Qdrant.

SandboxedRunTool: run Python/Node/C# in a jailed folder/container; no net, CPU/ram/time limits; return stdout + file artifacts.

FilesystemTool (restricted): read/write only under /workspace/<threadId>; size & type whitelist.

BrowserFetchTool (optional): headless fetching with robots.txt respect, URL allow-list.

Example: a safe sandbox runner

public class SandboxPlugin
{
  [KernelFunction, Description("Run a script safely in sandbox (python/node)")]
  public async Task<RunResult> Run(string language, string code, string workDir)
  {
    // 1) Validate lang, 2) write files into workDir, 3) run containerized process
    // 4) kill after timeout, 5) collect stdout/stderr/artifacts, 6) return summary
  }
}

6) Planning & hand-offs (multi-agent flow)

Use an Orchestration loop:

Orchestrator drafts plan →

Calls specific agent →

Receives result →

Decides next step or finalize.

Store a run graph (steps, agent, tool, inputs, outputs) in SQL for traceability.

7) Memory & knowledge (RAG)

Pipeline: ingest → chunk → embed → upsert.

Keep metadata (title, source, page, timestamp).

At query time, FilesAgent calls RAG.Search with the user question + chat context, re-ranks, then drafts an answer with quotes.

8) State, persistence, resumes

Threads table: threadId, userId, createdAt.

Messages table: threadId, role, content, tokens, cost.

Runs/Steps table: agent used, tool name, duration, success/failure.

Include retry & idempotency keys for tools.

9) Safety & governance (non-negotiable)

Tool allow-list per agent (principle of least privilege).

Argument validation (regex/JSON schema) before executing tools.

Rate limits & cost caps per user/thread.

Timeouts, CPU/mem quotas for sandbox.

URL allow-list/deny-list for web tooling.

Prompt guards: refuse PII exfiltration, malware creation, license-violating scraping.

10) Observability

Log prompts, tool calls, tokens, $ cost, latency.

Keep a Run Console page to replay steps and download artifacts.

Add evaluation sets (gold dialogs) to regression-test prompts and tools.

11) Frontend (quick start)

Minimal ASP.NET + React/Next chat:

chat bubble view, streaming responses, “show plan”, “show tools used”, “download artifacts”.

Attachments: user files go into /workspace/<threadId>/inputs.

“Run again with fixes” button that keeps context.

12) MVP checklist (2–3 days of work)

 AssistantAgent + chat UI (streaming).

 One ResearchAgent with WebSearchTool.

 One FilesAgent with RAG.Search over a small PDF folder.

 One CodeAgent with SandboxedRunTool (Python only).

 Orchestrator that can: plan → call research → call files → call code → finalize.

 Basic SQL persistence + token/cost logging.

 Safety gates (timeouts, allow-lists).

13) Example orchestration call (very short)
var plan = await orchestrator.InvokeAsync(
  "Build a short report on 'LLM agents' with 3 cited sources, plot a bar chart of model latency, and save as report.md."
);

// Under the hood:
// - ResearchAgent(web.search) → SummarizeTool → citations
// - CodeAgent(sandbox.run python) → generates chart.png
// - FilesAgent writes report.md referencing chart.png
// - Orchestrator returns final answer + artifacts list

14) Tech picks that fit your stack

LLM: Azure OpenAI (prod), OpenAI (dev).

Embeddings: text-embedding-3-large (or Azure equivalent).

Vector DB: PostgreSQL + pgvector (simple to deploy with your .NET stack).

Sandbox: Docker-in-Docker or a locked local runner with ProcessStartInfo + Job Objects (Windows) / cgroups (Linux).

Auth: Microsoft Identity; per-user quotas.

Background jobs: Hangfire for long tool runs.
